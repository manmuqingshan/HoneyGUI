## HoneyGUI Simulator

A simulator is a powerful tool used for developing UI that simulates the UI interface of embedded devices on a computer. It can mimic the behavior and appearance of a real hardware platform, providing developers with a convenient environment to quickly create, debug, and test UI designs.

The primary purpose of a simulator is to display and interactively test the designed UI interface in real-time, thereby reducing the time and cost of repetitive testing on actual hardware. By using a simulator, developers can iterate designs quickly, view the effects in real-time, and perform debugging and validation. This greatly speeds up UI development and improves workflow efficiency.

Using a simulator has the following advantages:
- Real-time preview: The simulator can show the immediate effects of the UI interface, allowing developers to quickly see the appearance and functionality of their design, facilitating adjustments and modifications.
- Cross-platform support: Simulators can run on computers, eliminating the need for specific hardware platforms.
- Time and resource-saving: Simulators help avoid frequent flashing and testing of UI on actual hardware, reducing additional time and cost overhead.
- Debugging and testing: Simulators provide rich debugging and testing capabilities to inspect the interaction, event handling, and layout effects of UI elements, aiding problem-solving and performance optimization.


### Run LVGL in HoneyGUI Simulator
HoneyGUI Simulator is based on the scons tool and MinGW-w64 toolchain. It can be run and debugged in VScode. For specific environment setup and running instructions, please refer to the [Getting Started - Installation](../../get-started/index.md) section.

After completing the environment setup for the HoneyGUI Simulator, when you start running it, you will see the default HoneyGUI project in the simulator. To modify the simulator configuration file to run an LVGL project, go to the path `your HoneyGUI dir/win32_sim/` and open the file `menu_config.h`, which is the configuration file for the simulator. Under the section "HoneyGUI Demo Select", comment out all the demos. Under the section "HoneyGUI Enable LVGL", enable `CONFIG_REALTEK_BUILD_LVGL_GUI`. Then, start running it again in VScode. After the build is successful, you will see the default LVGL demo project running in the simulator.

## Porting
- Documentation: [LVGL Porting](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/porting/index.html)

LVGL provides extensive porting support, allowing developers to easily integrate it into various embedded systems and platforms. It supports drivers for various display devices, touchscreens, input devices, and custom GPUs. Developers can configure the porting according to the requirements of their projects, such as adjusting the display parameters when changing display devices, or adapting the input interface when replacing input devices. This article focuses on the porting process and methods for display devices, input devices, and file systems. For more details, please refer to [LVGL Porting](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/porting/index.html).

__Note:__ The following examples do not include the specific implementation of hardware device drivers. They only illustrate how to integrate drivers with the LVGL interface. When implementing hardware device drivers, developers can complete the driver functionality under a consistent API framework with the example driver, in order to interface with the HoneyGUI driver layer. The porting interfaces of the example projects can be reused in higher layers.

### Display
- Documentation: [LVGL Porting Display](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/porting/display.html), [LVGL Overview Display](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/overview/display.html)

Once the developers have completed the debugging of the display device driver, and the device can communicate properly with the display device and show colors, it can be integrated with the display interface of LVGL to showcase LVGL's UI interface.

The display interface of LVGL is implemented in the file `lv_port_disp.c`. Display parameters are configured in the initialization function `void lv_port_disp_init(void)`, such as screen size and frame buffer configuration. The display refresh function is defined as `void disp_flush(lv_disp_drv_t *disp_drv, const lv_area_t *area, lv_color_t *color_p)`.

For detailed display device porting methods and considerations, please refer to the documentation [LVGL Porting Display](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/porting/display.html). The following code snippet demonstrates porting a display IC without RAM:

- When using a display IC without RAM, a frame buffer that covers the entire screen size needs to be allocated. Therefore, two frame buffers with a size equal to the screen size are allocated on the PSRAM for display. The macro definitions for display parameters are defined in the file `lv_conf.h`.
- If the display IC used has RAM, the size of the frame buffer does not need to be the same as the screen size. Due to different screen update methods, the `LVGL_USE_EDPI` in `lv_port_disp.c` needs to be configured as not enabled (0) to switch the `disp_flush` function for screen update adaptation.

```c
// flush func select: 1 (IC without RAM), 0 (IC with RAM) 
#define LVGL_USE_EDPI       1

// frame buffer config 
#define LV_PORT_BUF1        (uint32_t)0x08000000   // address in PSRAM
#define LV_PORT_BUF2        (uint32_t)(0x08000000 + MY_DISP_HOR_RES * MY_DISP_VER_RES * LV_COLOR_DEPTH / 8)

void lv_port_disp_init(void)
{
    /*-------------------------
     * Initialize your display
     * -----------------------*/
    disp_init();

    /*-----------------------------------
    * Register the display in LVGL
    *----------------------------------*/

    static lv_disp_drv_t disp_drv;                  /*Descriptor of a display driver*/
    lv_disp_drv_init(&disp_drv);                    /*Basic initialization*/

    /*Set up the functions to access to your display*/

    /*Set the resolution of the display*/
    disp_drv.hor_res = MY_DISP_HOR_RES;
    disp_drv.ver_res = MY_DISP_VER_RES;

    /*Used to copy the buffer's content to the display*/
    disp_drv.flush_cb = disp_flush;

    /*-----------------------------
     * Create a buffer for drawing
     *----------------------------*/

    /**
     * LVGL requires a buffer where it internally draws the widgets.
     * Later this buffer will passed to your display driver's `flush_cb` to copy its content to your display.
     * The buffer has to be greater than 1 display row
     *
     * There are 3 buffering configurations:
     * 1. Create ONE buffer:
     *      LVGL will draw the display's content here and writes it to your display
     *
     * 2. Create TWO buffer:
     *      LVGL will draw the display's content to a buffer and writes it your display.
     *      You should use DMA to write the buffer's content to the display.
     *      It will enable LVGL to draw the next part of the screen to the other buffer while
     *      the data is being sent form the first buffer. It makes rendering and flushing parallel.
     *
     * 3. Double buffering
     *      Set 2 screens sized buffers and set disp_drv.full_refresh = 1.
     *      This way LVGL will always provide the whole rendered screen in `flush_cb`
     *      and you only need to change the frame buffer's address.
     */
    static lv_disp_draw_buf_t draw_buf_dsc_3;
    lv_color_t *buf_3_1 = (lv_color_t *)LV_PORT_BUF1;           /*A screen sized buffer*/
    lv_color_t *buf_3_2 = (lv_color_t *)LV_PORT_BUF2;           /*Another screen sized buffer*/
    lv_disp_draw_buf_init(&draw_buf_dsc_3, buf_3_1, buf_3_2,
                          MY_DISP_VER_RES * MY_DISP_HOR_RES);   /*Initialize the display buffer*/

    /*Set a display buffer*/
    disp_drv.draw_buf = &draw_buf_dsc_3;

    /*Required for Example 3)*/
    disp_drv.full_refresh = 1;

    /* Fill a memory array with a color if you have GPU.
     * Note that, in lv_conf.h you can enable GPUs that has built-in support in LVGL.
     * But if you have a different GPU you can use with this callback.*/
    //disp_drv.gpu_fill_cb = gpu_fill;

    /*Finally register the driver*/
    lv_disp_drv_register(&disp_drv);
}


```


### Input Device
- Documentation: [LVGL Porting Input devices](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/porting/indev.html)

Once the developers have completed the debugging of the input device driver, and the device can communicate properly with the input device, it can be integrated with the input interface of LVGL to interact with LVGL's UI interface.

The input interface of LVGL is implemented in the file `lv_port_indev.c`. Input device parameters are configured in the initialization function `void lv_port_indev_init(void)`, including selecting the device type, etc. The input data acquisition function is configured in the function pointer `indev_drv.read_cb()`, which depends on the type of input device and is integrated in `lv_port_indev.c`.

For detailed input device porting methods and considerations, please refer to the documentation [LVGL Porting Input devices](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/porting/indev.html). The following code snippet demonstrates porting a touch IC:

- In the initialization function `void lv_port_indev_init(void)`, select and register the corresponding type of input device. For example, for a touchpad device, select `Touchpad`.
- LVGL will retrieve the input data through the function pointer `indev_drv.read_cb()`. Developers need to provide the input data in the function it points to. For a touch screen device, it would be the function `void touchpad_read(lv_indev_drv_t *indev_drv, lv_indev_data_t *data)`. For a touch screen input device, you only need to provide the coordinates of the touch point and the touch state.

```c

void lv_port_indev_init(void)
{
    /**
     * Here you will find example implementation of input devices supported by LittelvGL:
     *  - Touchpad
     *  - Mouse (with cursor support)
     *  - Keypad (supports GUI usage only with key)
     *  - Encoder (supports GUI usage only with: left, right, push)
     *  - Button (external buttons to press points on the screen)
     *
     *  The `..._read()` function are only examples.
     *  You should shape them according to your hardware
     */

    static lv_indev_drv_t indev_drv;

    /*------------------
     * Touchpad
     * -----------------*/

    /*Initialize your touchpad if you have*/
    touchpad_init();

    /*Register a touchpad input device*/
    lv_indev_drv_init(&indev_drv);
    indev_drv.type = LV_INDEV_TYPE_POINTER;
    indev_drv.read_cb = touchpad_read;
    indev_touchpad = lv_indev_drv_register(&indev_drv);
}

{
    /*Your code comes here*/
}

/*Will be called by the library to read the touchpad*/
static void touchpad_read(lv_indev_drv_t *indev_drv, lv_indev_data_t *data)
{
    static lv_coord_t last_x = 0;
    static lv_coord_t last_y = 0;

    /* rt touch read port */
    if (drv_touch_read(&touch_x, &touch_y, &touch_pressing) == false)
    {
        return;
    }

    /*Save the pressed coordinates and the state*/
    if (touchpad_is_pressed())
    {
        touchpad_get_xy(&last_x, &last_y);
        data->state = LV_INDEV_STATE_PR;
    }
    else
    {
        data->state = LV_INDEV_STATE_REL;
    }

    /*Set the last pressed coordinates*/
    data->point.x = last_x;
    data->point.y = last_y;
}
/*Return true is the touchpad is pressed*/
// static lv_coord_t touch_x;
// static lv_coord_t touch_y;
static bool touchpad_is_pressed(void)
{
    /*Your code comes here*/
    return touch_pressing;

}

/*Get the x and y coordinates if the touchpad is pressed*/
static void touchpad_get_xy(lv_coord_t *x, lv_coord_t *y)
{
    /*Your code comes here*/
    (*x) = touch_x;
    (*y) = touch_y;
}
```




### File System
- Documentation: [LVGL Overview File system](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/overview/file-system.html)

Using a file system to manage storage media makes data more organized and easier to maintain. It can improve compatibility and cross-platform support for external storage devices. Through the file system interface, developers can easily manipulate file data, making it more flexible and efficient. Integrating the file system with LVGL allows resource data to be stored separately from project code, reducing compilation time, improving development efficiency, and enhancing the flexibility of UI design.

The file system interface of LVGL is implemented in the file `lv_port_fs.c`. The file system is configured in the initialization function `void lv_port_fs_init(void)`, which includes initializing the file system and mounting drive letters. Developers need to integrate the interfaces of various file system functions into the corresponding LVGL fs porting functions, ensuring that the input and output data formats are consistent with the interface definitions.

For detailed file system porting methods and considerations, please refer to the documentation [LVGL Overview File system](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/overview/file-system.html). The following example demonstrates the porting of `romfs`.

```c
#include "romfs.h"

#### File System Image

HoneyGUI provides support for packaging `romfs` file system images:

1. The working directory is `your HoneyGUI dir/realgui/example/screen_lvgl/`. The packaging process requires Python environment support. The external file resources used in the project need to be packaged as a file system image and downloaded as `User Data`.

2. Open the working directory and place the files to be packaged in the `root/` folder. Double-click the `mkromfs_0x4600000.bat` script to generate the file system image `root(0x4600000).bin` and the resource mapping address `resource.h`. The default base address of the files is `0x4600000`. `resource.h` records the mapping address of the packaged files. Since `romfs` supports direct access using physical addresses, developers can access the resource files directly through the mapping address.

3. Use the `User Data` feature of the MP Tool to download and burn the file system image to flash. The burn address should match the base address. If you need to modify the base address, you can modify the `addr` parameter in the `mkromfs_0x4600000.bat` script. For example, the following example changes the base address from `0x4600000` to `0x4000000`.

```shell
# before - base address: 0x4600000, image: root(0x4600000).bin
python _bin_mkromfs.py --binary --addr 0x4600000 root root(0x4600000).bin


# after  - base address: 0x4000000, image: root(0x4000000).bin
python _bin_mkromfs.py --binary --addr 0x4000000 root root(0x4000000).bin
```

##  Start with Demo
- <a href="https://lvgl.io/demos">LVGL Demo</a>
- [LVGL Example](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/examples.html)

It is recommended for developers to read and understand the [LVGL Overview](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/overview/index.html) and [LVGL Widgets - Base object](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/widgets/obj.html) sections before starting development. This will help them grasp the design concepts and logic of LVGL.

LVGL provides a rich set of demos and examples to help developers understand and familiarize themselves with the usage of various controls and features.
- The [LVGL Demo](https://lvgl.io/demos) showcases comprehensive demos with their source code stored in the directory `your HoneyGUI dir/lvgl/src/demo`. Developers can directly invoke the corresponding `lv_demo_xxx()` function to explore and understand them.
- The online documentation [LVGL Example](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/examples.html) demonstrates the running effects of various examples, with their source code stored in the directory `your HoneyGUI dir/lvgl/src/example`. Developers can directly call the corresponding `lv_example_xxx()` function to familiarize themselves with controls and understand their features.

## Resource Converter
To use images and fonts in LVGL, they need to be converted to formats that LVGL can recognize using specific tools. LVGL supports converting resources to C array format and bin binary file format. 

In the C array format, the resources will be included in the compilation process. They will be compiled every time the program logic changes, and the size of the resources will be included in the APP image. 

In the bin binary file format, the resources are not included in the compilation. They are stored separately and require a file system or other means to access them. An example `lvgl_example_assets.c` is provided in the path `your HoneyGUI dir/realgui/example/screen_lvgl/assets/` to demonstrate how to configure resources of different formats for the widgets.

### LVGL Image Converter
- Online conversion tool: [LVGL Image Converter](https://lvgl.io/tools/imageconverter)
- Documentation: [LVGL Overview Images](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/overview/image.html)

Please refer to the following steps for usage in [LVGL Overview Images - Online Converter](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/overview/image.html#online-converter):

1. Select the LVGL version.
2. Choose the image file.
3. Select the color format for the output file. For color format details, please refer to [LVGL Overview Images - color format](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/overview/image.html#color-formats).
4. Choose the type of output image (C array/binary file).
5. Click "Convert" to obtain the output file.

The [LVGL Overview Images](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/overview/image.html) document provides detailed instructions on how to use image resources and the image conversion tool in LVGL, along with simple usage examples. To automatically build image resources generated as C arrays, place them under the directory `your HoneyGUI dir/realgui/example/screen_lvgl/assets/` directory.

It's worth mentioning that when using the bin file as an image resource, the data in the bin file follows the format of `4 Byte header + data`. The `header` contains information such as `Color format`, `width`, and `height`. To construct a complete `lv_img_dsc_t` to describe the image, you can calculate the `data_size` using the information from the `header`.

```c
typedef struct {

    uint32_t cf : 5;          /*Color format: See `lv_img_color_format_t`*/
    uint32_t always_zero : 3; /*It the upper bits of the first byte. Always zero to look like a
                                 non-printable character*/

    uint32_t reserved : 2; /*Reserved to be used later*/

    uint32_t w : 11; /*Width of the image map*/
    uint32_t h : 11; /*Height of the image map*/
} lv_img_header_t;

/** Image header it is compatible with
 * the result from image converter utility*/
typedef struct {
    lv_img_header_t header; /**< A header describing the basics of the image*/
    uint32_t data_size;     /**< Size of the image in bytes*/
    const uint8_t * data;   /**< Pointer to the data of the image*/
} lv_img_dsc_t;
```

### HoneyGUI Image Convert Tool
- Download link for the conversion tool: [HoneyGUI Image Convert Tool](https://docs.realmcu.com/HoneyGUI/en/latest/tool/index.html)
- Documentation: [HoneyGUI Image Convert Tool - Doc](https://docs.realmcu.com/HoneyGUI/en/latest/tool/Resource/image.html)

When further compression of image resource space is needed, the HoneyGUI Image Convert Tool supports compressing and converting images. The IC supports both software and hardware decoding. The HoneyGUI Image Convert Tool uses RLE (Run-length Encoding) compression, a simple lossless algorithm that reduces storage space by encoding consecutive repeated pixel values and the number of repetitions. It has low computational complexity and high compression rates, making it ideal for compressing GUI resources.

##### Compressing Images
Users can utilize the HoneyGUI Image Convert Tool to convert image resources into RLE-compressed binary file format. For detailed usage steps, please refer to [HoneyGUI Image Convert Tool - Doc](https://docs.realmcu.com/HoneyGUI/en/latest/tool/Resource/image.html):

1. Select the image file to be compressed (supports PNG, JPEG, etc.)
1. Configure the image conversion parameters: enable `Compress`, choose `Compress Mode` as `RLE`, enable `Color Head`, and select `Color Space` as needed
1. Click to convert and generate a compressed binary file

##### Importing into LVGL
The binary files generated by the HoneyGUI Image Convert Tool can be imported into LVGL for use:

1. If importing as a file, modify the file extension to `.rle` to use it in the file system
2. If importing as a C array format, use the LVGL image conversion tool for the conversion. Unlike converting regular images, select the compressed file for upload, and in the `Color format` option, select **CF_RAW**

##### Enabling RLE Decoder in LVGL
To decode RLE compressed image resources in LVGL, you need to enable the RLE decoder and allocate cache space for it.

1. Enable the RLE decoder: in the configuration file `lv_conf.h`, locate the `LV_USE_RLE` macro definition and  set it to enable (1)
2. Allocate decoding cache: Configure the following parameters in the `lv_rle.c` file:
    - `LV_SSRAM-START`: The starting address of the cache
    - `LV_SSRAM_SIZE`: Cache space size, ensuring that this size is sufficient to accommodate the decoding data of the largest entire image used


```c
// file: lv_conf.h
#define LV_USE_RLE                1


// file: lv_rle.c
#define LV_PSRAM_SIZE       (MY_DISP_HOR_RES * MY_DISP_VER_RES * 4) // screen size * 4(ARGB8888)
#define LV_PSRAM_START      (0x08000000 + 2 * MY_DISP_HOR_RES * MY_DISP_VER_RES * LV_COLOR_DEPTH / 8)  // frame buffer offset
#define LV_PSRAM_END        (LV_PSRAM_START + LV_PSRAM_SIZE)

```

Note:
- When using the RLE decoder along with ROMFS, the decoder will directly obtain images from the file system, i.e., FLASH, without additional caching.

### Font Converter
- Online conversion tool: [LVGL Font Converter](https://lvgl.io/tools/fontconverter)
- Documentation: [LVGL Overview Fonts](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/overview/font.html)

Please refer to the following steps for usage in [LVGL Overview Font - Add a new font](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/overview/font.html#add-a-new-font):

1. Set the name of the output font.
2. Set the height of the font in pixels.
3. Set the bpp (bits per pixel) of the font. It represents how many bits are used to describe each pixel. Higher values result in better anti-aliasing and smoother edges, but larger font file size.
4. Choose the type of output font (C array/bin file).
5. Select the font file (TTF/WOFF).
6. Set the Unicode range of characters to convert, or directly list the characters that need to be converted.

The [LVGL Overview Fonts](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/overview/font.html) document provides detailed instructions on how to use font resources and the font conversion tool in LVGL, along with simple usage examples. In the example, `lv_example_label_3()` demonstrates how to configure a specific font for a label control. To automatically build font resources generated as C arrays, place them under the directory `your HoneyGUI dir/realgui/example/screen_lvgl/assets/` directory.

LVGL provides built-in fonts, which are saved as arrays in the directory `your HoneyGUI dir/lvgl/src/font/`. Each font file specifies the included characters at the beginning of the file. The built-in fonts include a Chinese font, `lv_font_simsun_16_cjk.c`, which is a CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) 16px font, but it is a single font size with a limited character set.

#### Analysis

Extra PSRAM is required for RGB screen as a cache buffer. LVGL uses PSRAM completely as its image cache buffer compared to HoneyGUI which combines RAM and PSRAM. LVGL performs worse overall.

#### Conclusion

- **Applicable Scenarios**: For large screen sizes (e.g. 800x480) and full-frame drawing, HoneyGUI is recommended. For frequent partial screen refresh projects, LVGL is recommended. For block drawing when RAM resources are tight, HoneyGUI is recommended, with section recommended parameters set to 10.
- **Rotation, Scaling**: LVGL performs faster in 2D rendering using a 2x2 matrix compared to HoneyGUI's 3x3 matrix, which handles more data for 2D rendering. For 2.5D or pseudo-3D effects, HoneyGUI will perform better.
- In practical projects, select the suitable framework based on specific frame rate requirements, system resources, and other functional needs. Conduct specific performance testing and evaluation if possible.

This analysis provides valuable insights for selecting the appropriate display framework and assists decision-makers in making the best choice based on actual requirements.
