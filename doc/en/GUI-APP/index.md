# GUI Application

The GUI framework diagram is shown in the figure below:

  +  In each project, multiple applications can exist simultaneously, but only one application can be in a running state at any given time, while the other applications will be in a suspended state.
  +  When using different rendering engines, the upper-layer implementation of the application will vary.
  +  Each [APP](/Glossary.rst#term-APP) can create its own dedicated thread, or it may choose not to.
  +  The APP can be installed, opened, closed, uninstalled, and switched.
  +  The GUI_SERVER performs operations such as traversing controls according to refresh instructions, rendering the frame buffer, executing trigger callbacks, and scheduling apps.
