# Software Accelerate

## Overall Flow Chart
The flowchart depicts the image resource processing flow accelerated by software. When processing images, different processing methods are selected based on the compression status and type of image:

- **Cover**: Write the source image data directly to the corresponding position in the frame buffer. Do not perform any processing, just overwrite it.
- **Bypass**: Write the source image data directly to the corresponding position in the frame buffer. Bypass mode is incapable of handling the transparency of images. It applies a global opacity value to the entire image, thereby affecting the overall transparency. When it comes to creating transparency effects, bypass mode is more space-efficient compared to source_over mode.
- **Filter black**: The filtering technique effectively sifts out pixel data with a value of zero from the originating image data, which essentially means that black pixels are precluded from being inscribed into the frame buffer. This mechanism induces much swifter refresh dynamics. Pixels of any color other than black undergo the standard processing method and are duly recorded into the frame buffer.
- **Source_over**: A blending method that combines image color data and frame buffer pixel color data to calculate the final color based on the opacity_value value `Sa`, and writes it to the corresponding location in the frame buffer. The formula is `((255 - Sa) * D + Sa * S) / 255)`, where `Sa` is the opacity_value of the original image, `D` is the frame buffer pixel data, and `S` is the source image pixel data.

- The `img_type` can be obtained from the `head` of the image, where the structure of the image head is as follows.

```
typedef struct gui_rgb_data_head
{
    unsigned char scan : 1;
    unsigned char align : 1;
    unsigned char resize: 2; //0-no resize;1-50%(x&y);2-70%;3-80%
    unsigned char compress: 1;
    unsigned char rsvd : 3;
    char type;
    short w;
    short h;
    char version;
    char rsvd2;
} gui_rgb_data_head_t;
```
- The value of `img_type` is depicted in the enum below. If the value is `IMDC_COMPRESS`, it indicates that the image is compressed and enters the `rle` processing flow; otherwise, it enters the `no rle` processing flow.

```
typedef enum
{
    RGB565      = 0, //bit[4:0] for Blue, bit[10:5] for Green, bit[15:11] for Red
    ARGB8565    = 1, //bit[4:0] for Blue, bit[10:5] for Green, bit[15:11] for Red, bit[23:16] for Alpha
    RGB888      = 3, //bit[7:0] for Blue, bit[15:8] for Green, bit[23:16] for Red
    ARGB8888    = 4, //bit[7:0] for Blue, bit[15:8] for Green, bit[23:16] for Red, bit[21:24] for Alpha
    BINARY      = 5,
    ALPHAMASK   = 9,
    BMP         = 11,
    JPEG        = 12,
    PNG         = 13,
    GIF         = 14,
    RTKARGB8565 = 15,
} GUI_FormatType;
```

- Execute the corresponding `blit` process based on different `blend_mode`.
```
typedef enum
{
    IMG_BYPASS_MODE = 0,
    IMG_FILTER_BLACK,
    IMG_SRC_OVER_MODE, //S * Sa + (1 - Sa) * D
    IMG_COVER_MODE,
    IMG_RECT,
} BLEND_MODE_TYPE;
```

- When the image is compressed, it is necessary to obtain the compression header from the address of the compressed data. The `algorithm_type` parameter of this header contains the actual image type. The types of compressed images are described in the `imdc_src_type` struct, which includes three types: `IMDC_SRC_RGB565`, `IMDC_SRC_RGB888`, and `IMDC_SRC_ARGB8888`.
```
typedef struct imdc_file_header
{
    struct
    {
        uint8_t algorithm: 2;
        uint8_t feature_1: 2;
        uint8_t feature_2: 2;
        uint8_t pixel_bytes: 2;
    } algorithm_type;
    uint8_t reserved[3];
    uint32_t raw_pic_width;
    uint32_t raw_pic_height;
} imdc_file_header_t;
```
```
typedef enum
{
    IMDC_SRC_RGB565 = 0x04, // 4,
    IMDC_SRC_RGB888 = 0x44, // 68,
    IMDC_SRC_ARGB8888 = 0x84, // 132,

} imdc_src_type;
```
