How To Increase FPS
=====================

Pixel format
------------

Using RGBA/RGB images can get great display effects, but if the FPS is low, then you can use
RGB565 format image resources, sacrifice a little effect to get a FPS boost.

Hardware Acceleration
---------------------

Use hardware acceleration to render images instead of software acceleration whenever possible.
Different chip models may have different GPU, please refer to the guidance document in the SDK for
details.

Data Transmission Speed
-----------------------

HoneyGUI supports image compression, and some chips have built-in hardware decompression modules.
Using hardware decompression modules is very fast, but software decompression requires a certain
amount of time. Compressed images can reduce the size of the original image resources, allowing more
resources to be stored in user data, and will also reduce the time needed to read from flash.

UI Design
---------

Reducing complexity in the UI, as well as the number and size of images in a single interface, can
increase the frame rate. Make sure that every pixel of the image data that needs to be loaded is
useful.

Image Compression
-----------------

Almost all image compression reduces the refresh rate of the UI, so avoid using compressed images
if the memory size is sufficient.

Font
----

Custom Binary Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use multiples of 8 for font size whenever possible.
- When the file contains several hundred characters, `indexMethod` should be set to 0 when creating
  the font file.

Standard TTF Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Using TTF files to display text is significantly slower than using BIN.
- TTF files can be clipped through an open source solution.
