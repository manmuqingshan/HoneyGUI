User Data
---------

User Data bin image generation need to consider user data address in ``flash_map.h``. Normally the address
in generate script is consistent with user data address in ``flash_map.h``, and if user data bin need to
add image data header due to ``mppgtool`` requirement, the generate script address must increase by image
data header size.

JS Malloc Heap
--------------

JS (javascript) is included in GUI module, the heap space JS used may fail to malloc due to resource
limitation, so this heap space could relocate on psram if SoC supports psram feature. The specific
information can be found in the API ``void *context_alloc(size_t size, void *cb_data_p)``.

Feed Watch Dog
--------------

GUI task does not support feeding the watch dog, so the app should do this in a hook function registered
by the APP and used by GUI. The registered function is ``void gui_task_ext_execution_sethook(void (*hook)(void))``.

Not Support FPU
---------------

If SoC does not support FPU, some headers and code should be excluded by macros, for example, RTL8763EP.

File System
-----------

SoC needs to read image and font resources from flash by file system which should set a start address
that is consistent with the address in User Data generation script. GUI has supplied the related file
which is ``romfs.c`` where the start address is ``ROMFS_ADDR``.

Flash Setting
-------------

Flash speed mode should be set to 4 bit mode; flash clock should be set to a higher value based on chip
capabilities.

CPU Frequence
-------------

CPU frequency should be set to a higher value based on chip capabilities.

SCONS Version
-------------

A specific scons version is required, please use the ``pip install scons==4.4.0`` command to download.
